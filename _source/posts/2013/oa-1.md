Summary: A short introduction to open access.

*Note: This post is a response to [this task](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/5/content/365/) of an [online course on open science](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/5/open-science-an-introduction/) I am following. In addition to the sources mentioned in text, I have also used a blog post from fellow participant [Quentin Reul](http://linked-data.blogspot.com/2013/08/introduction-to-open-access.html).*

Open access is **free**, **immediate**, and **online** availability of peer-reviewed research articles and other scientific works. It has several advantages over traditional publication practices and will hopefully replace those in the long term.

## Old model

The invention of the [printing press](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) in the 15th century suddenly allowed works to be created, copied and distributed to a wide audience, rather than being painstakingly copied by hand. Scientific societies were founded, which used this tool to facilitate the publication of scientific works (peer-reviewing, type-setting, distributing). To recoup the (rather high) costs, articles were published in [subscription based](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model) journals.

## New model

This business model has worked for a long time (and is still the dominant model in use today), but since the ubiquity of the internet, the **cost of publishing** works has decreased dramatically, so other publication models are possible.

Numerous scientific works are also the result of scientific research that is funded with public money, so there is a **moral duty** to make those results available fast and free to anyone.

And publicly available scientific works **increase the efficiency** of research, not only research in general, but also the research of the author of the article, by:

* Reaching a wider (and different) audience
* Publishing research results faster (including [negative results](http://blog.f1000research.com/2013/05/15/no-article-fee-for-negative-results-until-end-of-august/))
* Increasing engagement and collaboration
* Increasing transparency (which allows reproducibility and plagiarism detection)
* Allowing [alt metrics](http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/) systems to be build around scientific works

The importance of open access is [illustrated in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5rVH1KGBCY) by [Nick Shockey](https://twitter.com/R2RC), [Jonathan Eisen](https://twitter.com/phylogenomics) and [Jorge Cham](https://twitter.com/phdcomics) (of the excellent [PhD Comics](http://www.phdcomics.com/)).

## Licenses

From a legal perspective, the open access movement has been made possible by the creation of licenses - such as the [Creative Commons licenses](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/) - that allow copyright holders to loosen some of the rights they hold over their work. The [CC-BY license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) for example, which I use for this blog post (see [LICENSE](http://peterdesmet.com/LICENSE.txt)), allows anyone to legally share and remix the work, as long as they credit the original source.

## Flavours of open access

As with any paradigm shift, the ultimate goal of [open access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) won't be reached immediately, so there are different flavours of open access:

* **Green open access**: the journal might no be open access, but the authors can [self-archive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-archiving) their article under an open access license (here's a [tutorial](http://datapub.cdlib.org/2012/11/06/researchers-make-your-previous-work-oa/)).
* **Gold open access**: the [journal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_journal) itself is open access (see for example the [Directory on open access journals](http://www.doaj.org/)).
    * **Gratis open access**: The article is available online at no-cost.
    * **Libre open access**: The article is available online at no-cost and there are additional usage rights (yeay!)
