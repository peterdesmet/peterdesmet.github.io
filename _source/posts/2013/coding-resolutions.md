Summary: Resolutions in coding land. Also, fantasy pets.

It's mid-January, but it's never too late to make some resolutions to feel bad about not reaching at the end of the year. Mine are coding-related and hardly world-shattering, giving me a chance to actually reach them.

## Learning

I'm enjoying the courses on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/), but since I have a tendency to abandon them before I reach the end, here are my learning resolutions:

* Finish the [Python course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)
* Finish the [JavaScript course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
* Finish the [jQuery course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery)
* Create [3 projects](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/projects)
* Follow [3 API courses](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/apis)

And as a bonus, [try R on Code School](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r).

## Creating

Learning is fine, but doing is better:

* Create a data repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/peterdesmet) and release it to the public domain.
* Create a one-page website visualizing data, using the [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/) API.
* Transfer [my website](http://www.anderhalv.be) from WordPress to GitHub, using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/).
* Write at least 5 posts.

And as a bonus, create a theme for my website.

## Contributing

* Contribute at least once a month to someone else's repository or documentation. (Must. keep. [contributions summary.](https://github.com/peterdesmet) active.)

And as a bonus, help an old lady cross the street and/or nurture a wounded fantasy animal into a powerful pet ally.
