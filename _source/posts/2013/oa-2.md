Summary: And how well is the journal communicating this?

*Note: This post is a response to [this task](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/5/content/366/) of an [online course on open science](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/5/open-science-an-introduction/) I am following.*

In my [previous post](|filename|oa-1.md), I explained what open access is. But we can go beyond the simple question of "Is it open access?" and evaluate how open a resource actually is.

PLOS, SPARC and OASPA developed a **[2-page guide](http://www.plos.org/about/open-access/howopenisit/)** to do just that. I will use it to assess the openness of [my first paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.25.3100) (co-written with Luc Brouillet) that was published two weeks ago in [PhytoKeys](http://www.pensoft.net/journals/phytokeys), a [Pensoft](http://www.pensoft.net/) journal. Not as a vanity project, but to figure out how well I - as an advocate for open - am doing by submitting my paper to PhytoKeys as the journal.

> Desmet P, Brouillet L (2013) Database of Vascular Plants of Canada (VASCAN): a community contributed taxonomic checklist of all vascular plants of Canada, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Greenland. PhytoKeys 25: 55â€“67. doi: [10.3897/phytokeys.25.3100](http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.25.3100) Resource ID: GBIF key: <http://gbrds.gbif.org/browse/agent?uuid=3f8a1297-3259-4700-91fc-acc4170b27ce>

## Reader rights

> This journal provides immediate open access to its content on the principle that making research freely available to the public supports a greater global exchange of knowledge. ([source](http://www.pensoft.net/journals/phytokeys/about/Open%20Access%20Policy#Open Access Policy))

No fees, no embargoes, better science. **5/5**

## Reuse rights

> The article and any associated published material is distributed under the [Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 (CC-BY)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). ([source](http://www.pensoft.net/journals/phytokeys/about/Open%20Access%20Policy#Copyright%20Notice))

Reusing and remixing galore. **5/5**

## Copyrights

> Copyright on any article is retained by the author(s). [...] ([source](http://www.pensoft.net/journals/phytokeys/about/Open%20Access%20Policy#Copyright%20Notice))

And the transfer of copyrights between the authors and publisher is regulated through the CC-BY license (which applies to anyone), but some of these rights are explicitly spelled out in the policy. Nice! **5/5**

## Author posting rights

> [...] Authors are thus encouraged to post the pdf files of published papers on their homepages or elsewhere to expedite distribution. [...] ([source](http://www.pensoft.net/journals/phytokeys))

This encouragement is not mentioned in the editorial policies, but on the journal's homepage. It is not 100% clear if pre-prints (before peer-review) can be posted as well, but the fact that:

> The work described has not been published before (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture, review or thesis) [...] ([source](http://www.pensoft.net/journals/phytokeys/about/Open%20Access%20Policy#Copyright%20Notice))

... and a [SHERPA/RoMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/search.php) search indicating PhytoKeys as a blue journal, with a "pre-print archiving status unclear", leads me to conclude that this is not allowed. **4/5**

## Automatic posting

> Archived in [PubMedCentral](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/journals/1603/) and [CLOCKSS](http://www.clockss.org/). ([source](http://www.pensoft.net/journals/phytokeys))

The journal is [indeed archived](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/journals/1603/) in PubMedCentral, but the latest issue (25) is not available yet. I'm assuming this will be done within 6 months. **4/5**

## Machine readability

This criterion is more verbose:

> Article full text, metadata, citations, & data, including supplementary data, provided in community machine-readable standard formats through a community standard API or protocol. ([source](http://www.plos.org/about/open-access/howopenisit/))

... so let's break it up in parts:

The article (including full text, metadata, citations) is [available as XML](http://www.pensoft.net/J_FILES/3/articles/3100/3100-G-2-layout.xml). These XML files are also deposited on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pensoft/PhytoKeys-xml) and seem to be marked up in a community standard (see the xml header info) and provided through a standard API or protocol (GitHub and http). I'm not sure the links to included figures work, as these don't start with `http://`.

In addition, I posted the full article (including figures) as an editable, [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatted text file on [GitHub](https://github.com/peterdesmet/vascan-data-paper).

The data, which are hosted on the [Canadensys Repository](http://dx.doi.org/10.5886/Y7SMZY5P) and [indexed by GBIF](http://data.gbif.org/datasets/resource/13558) are available as a [Darwin Core archive](http://www.gbif.org/informatics/standards-and-tools/publishing-data/data-standards/darwin-core-archives/), which is a community standard, and are provided through a standard protocol (http). There are no supplementary data. **5/5**

## Conclusion

**28/30**, which is awesome!

Congrats to the folks at [Pensoft](http://www.pensoft.net/) on providing [clear policies for PhytoKeys](http://www.pensoft.net/journals/phytokeys/about/Open%20Access%20Policy), although the author posting rights and automatic posting could be clarified. Please let me know if I misinterpreted something.
