A friend asked if I could design two characters for her thesis. She had developed a curriculum with 'Fashion' as the recurring theme and each chapter was introduced by two novice fashion designers: Milan & Eveline. I wanted to familiarize myself with Photoshop and design something in a stylized retro-look for a while, so I started from scratch in Photoshop. Eveline was the first and hardest to draw, Milan went a lot easier. Learned a lot!
