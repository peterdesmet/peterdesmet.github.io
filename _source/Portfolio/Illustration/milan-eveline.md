A friend asked if I could design two characters for her thesis. She had
developed a curriculum with 'Fashion' as the recurring theme and each
chapter was introduced by two novice fashion designers: Milan & Eveline.
I wanted to familiarize myself with Photoshop and design something in a
stylized retro-look for a while, so I started from scratch in Photoshop.
Eveline was the first and hardest to draw, Milan went a lot easier.
Learned a lot!
