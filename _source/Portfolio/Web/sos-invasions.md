While I was working on the Dutch translation of this website, I
discovered how horrible the HTML code was. The website was designed by a
[colleague][] in Dreamweaver and the generated code was just frustrating
to work with. I also wanted to learn [CSS][], so I recreated the website
with some help from a [colleague/programmer][]. It's my very first
website using 'divs' and 'handcoded' css, and it's still online (with
some gorgeous HTML code :) ): [SOS Invasions!][]
