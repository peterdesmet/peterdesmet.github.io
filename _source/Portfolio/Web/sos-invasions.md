While I was working on the Dutch translation of this website, I discovered how horrible the HTML code was. The website was designed by a [colleague](http://biobel.biodiversity.be/person/show/977) in Dreamweaver and the generated code was just frustrating to work with. I also wanted to learn [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), so I recreated the website with some help from a [colleague/programmer](http://biobel.biodiversity.be/person/show/471). It's my very first website using 'divs' and 'handcoded' css, and it's still online (with some gorgeous HTML code :) ): [SOS Invasions!](http://ias.biodiversity.be/meetings/200603_sos_invasions/)
