[![Canadensys community portal](http://www.anderhalv.be/wp-content/uploads/web-canadensys-community-home.png)](http://www.anderhalv.be/wp-content/uploads/web-canadensys-community-home.png)

Design for the [Canadensys](http://www.canadensys.net/) website. I choose red as our "corporate" colour, because it's Canadian and I wanted the project to stand out among other biodiversity related projects, which often use green or green/blue. I also just like red, it's my favourite colour for webdesign. :-) The site has a fixed width, but I'm using the whole page to make it look similar to the upcoming [data portal](http://data.canadensys.net/), which will be using a fluid width. The community portal is powered by [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) and [Pierre BÃ©lisle](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/pierrebelisle).
