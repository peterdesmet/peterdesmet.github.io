[![Canadensys community portal][]][Canadensys community portal]

Design for the [Canadensys][] website. I choose red as our "corporate"
colour, because it's Canadian and I wanted the project to stand out
among other biodiversity related projects, which often use green or
green/blue. I also just like red, it's my favourite colour for
webdesign. :-) The site has a fixed width, but I'm using the whole page
to make it look similar to the upcoming [data portal][], which will be
using a fluid width. The community portal is powered by
[WordPress,][]some other [stuff][] and [Pierre Bélisle][].
