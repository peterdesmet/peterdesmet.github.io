Hi, I'm Peter. I'm a **biodiversity informatician**. I develop research software (like [Petridish](https://peterdesmet.com/petridish) and [Frictionless R](https://frictionlessdata.github.io/frictionless-r/)), maintain data standards (like [Camtrap DP](https://camtrap-dp.tdwg.org)) and publish datasets covering animal tracking, camera traps, citizen science, invasive alien species, and radar aeroecology. I ❤️ open science and work as open data coordinator and team lead for INBO's [Open science lab for biodiversity](https://oscibio.inbo.be/) in Belgium.

This website mainly acts as a home for a number of [blog posts](/posts/) I wrote in 2013. For more recent work, see [GitHub](https://github.com/peterdesmet) and [INBO](https://pureportal.inbo.be/en/persons/peter-desmet).
